  I'm a senior full-stack, AI, and blockchain developer focused on building scalable, efficient, and secure applications. I specialize in designing and developing end-to-end solutions using modern web technologies, including JavaScript (React, Node.js), Python (FastAPI, Django), and blockchain frameworks such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. My expertise spans across AI and machine learning, where I implement cutting-edge algorithms and models to create intelligent systems that solve complex problems.
  
  
  In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about writing clean, modular code, optimizing system performance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software. I have a proven track record of delivering enterprise-level applications, integrating third-party services, and driving innovation in blockchain and AI fields.
